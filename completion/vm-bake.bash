# bash completion for vm-bake
#
# The shell side is deliberately thin: it hands the words typed so far to
# 'vm-bake complete', which derives the candidates from the #@help corpus
# (command words from the @command usages, placeholder values from the
# database via @completion/@defcompletion). Nothing here needs updating when
# commands are added or renamed.
#
# Install (any one of):
#   /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/vm-bake     (make install)
#   ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/vm-bake        (per user)
#   . completion/vm-bake.bash                                 (ad hoc)
#
# Protocol: one candidate per line; the lines "@files" and "@dirs" ask the
# shell to complete paths itself. A line with spaces is never a candidate
# (a usage error for a line too long to complete) and is dropped.
